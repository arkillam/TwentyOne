Initial project created using Eclipse, Maven and the excellent Maven archetype "spring-mvc-archetype" which can be found here:

https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cfr.uha.ensisa.ff%7Cspring-mvc-archetype%7C1.0.3%7Cmaven-archetype

Also found these instructions handy (was using mvn from the command lind until now):

Caution:  archetype created a Spring 3 project, I had to manually upgrade to the Spring 5 that I wanted (only change of note was reworking the configuration class a bit)
